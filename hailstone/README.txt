a function named hailstone that takes the starting integer as a parameter and returns how many steps it takes to reach 1.  If the starting integer is 1, the return value should be 0, since it takes no steps to reach one (we're already there). If the starting integer is 3, then the sequence would go: 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, and the return value should be 7.  The function will just return the value, not display it.
