This program uses two recursive functions, binToDec and
decToBin. binToDec takes as a parameter a C++ string of '1's and '0's that
are the binary representation of a positive integer and returns the 
equivalent int value. decToBin takes as a parameter a positive int value,
and returns a C++ string of '1's and '0's that are the binary representation
of that number.
